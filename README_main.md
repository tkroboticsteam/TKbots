Collection of robotics projects by TKRobotics (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi)
# TKbots

**TKbots** is a collection of competitive and research robotics projects developed by the **TKRobotics** team.

This repository represents our practical experience in designing, building, and programming robots for real competitions, where reliability, speed, and clear logic matter most.

## About TKRobotics

**TKRobotics** is a student robotics team focused on hands-on engineering and competition robotics.

We work as a single system:
- each team member contributes to mechanics, electronics, and programming  
- all solutions are tested under real conditions  
- every project is built to perform, not to demonstrate theory  

Our experience comes from multiple robotics competitions and long-term project development.

## Our Robotics Experience

The projects in this repository are based on real platforms we have built and tested:

- RC cars with wireless control and high-speed motor systems  
- Sumo robots where reliability and reaction time decide the match  
- Sports and football robots with precise movement and control  
- Scientific and experimental robotic platforms  

These projects are built using:
- **Arduino**
- **ESP32**
- **Raspberry Pi**

## Arduino Hackathon Project

This repository includes the control system used for our **Arduino Hackathon** robot.

### Key features:
- Wi-Fi control (works from phone and laptop)
- Real-time motor control
- Stable and predictable movement
- Designed for competition conditions and fast decision-making

The robot control logic is fully developed, tested, and understood by our team.

## Technologies & Tools

- ESP32 microcontroller  
- Arduino IDE  
- DC motors and motor drivers  
- Web-based control interface  
- CAD-based mechanical design

## Philosophy

We don’t build prototypes for display.  
We build systems that work under pressure.

Every line of code, every mechanical decision, and every connection is made with competition in mind.
