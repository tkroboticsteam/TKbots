## Key Features
- Wi-Fi based control (phone & laptop)
- Omnidirectional movement
- Real-time motor response
- Stable and predictable behavior

---

## Hardware
- ESP32
- DC motors with motor drivers
- Mecanum wheels
- Custom robot frame

---

## Control System
The control system is implemented using a web-based interface hosted directly on the ESP32.

Commands are processed instantly to ensure smooth movement and fast reaction during matches.
