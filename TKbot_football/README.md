TKbot Football — ESP32 Robot Platform

TKbot Football is a competitive robot football platform developed by the TKRobotics team.

The robot is built on an ESP32 38-pin controller and designed for real match conditions, fast movement, and stable wireless control.

What this project includes?

-ESP32 control code
-Circuit diagrams
-CAD models and mechanical design
-Assembly logic
-Testing and movement implementation
-Key features
-Omnidirectional movement with mecanum wheels
-Wireless control via Wi-Fi
-Precise motor control
-Stable behavior during fast rotations and collisions
-Development process

The robot was:

designed in CAD

programmed and configured

assembled and wired

tested in real competition-style conditions

This project reflects practical robotics experience, where every solution is tested through real movement, debugging, and iteration.
